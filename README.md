# Shell-Plc-Analysis
Europe interests or UK interests.

In this project we will analyse Shell PLC and what might have been the cause of its move from the Netherlands to the UK. In order to see the possible causes we will look into its finances, political and legal reasons.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.
